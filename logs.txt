  x sustain too long
    add limitation on sustain time
    > more diverse, have longer pattern

  x dive into slience (no 1 at all)
    randomize the input when slient
    > no slience 
  ===>0000.mid

  > try stateful RNN
    but not aligned with one song when training
    > not good, all slience

  > change mse to binary_crossentropy
    much less confidence
    > use threshold==0.3
      > not bad, has rhythm ====> 0001.mid
      comes to slience and start again 
        > use note/=max strategy, not good ===> 0002.mid
      > add noise
        still slience but more diverse 0003.mid
      > use binomial random (1, 0.3) rather than uniform
        more diverse 0004.mid
      > use binomial random (1, 0.6)
        it got emotional sometimes LOL 0005.mid
      > use binomial random (1, 0.8)
        more keys, but in an aweful styel 0006.mid 

    ==> conclusion
      overfit on one tune, which is bad (or good?)
