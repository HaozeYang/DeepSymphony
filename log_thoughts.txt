Using RNN as discriminator
  - Cannot even learn the pattern that most part should be black (slience)
  > The backward gradient/direction is fused in the whole sequence, we 
  should localize those guidance
     1: 1D conv
     2: feed back on embedding rather than notes
     3: low resolution to high resolution
          (like image generation: (7, 7)->(14, 14)->(32, 32))
